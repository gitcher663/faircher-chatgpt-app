# UI Spec

The UI is a standalone Vite + React application that renders the ads summary
returned by the MCP server.

## Requirements

- Consume data from `window.openai.toolOutput`.
- Display summary, distribution, and advertiser details.
- Provide an empty state when no ads are detected.

## TODO

- Add visual design guidelines (typography, spacing, color palette).
- Include accessibility requirements.
